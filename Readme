Technologies: using Java, JPA, HTML, JSP, EL, JSTL, and servlets. Projects should not use Javascript, or any software systems that require additional jar files, such as Spring. Design and implement a multiple-JSP-page UI for the music project (music3.zip), following the general UI flow specified in Murach originally, and simplified as shown in the Music UI page flow diagram in the text book. Tie the two UIs together by having a home page for the whole system with the simple choice of User or Admin service. Now it is easy to provide the capability of listening to the samples listed in table track. The Sound page will list only the tracks with samples if you write a single page for any CD using track table data. You may use the catalog/*/index.jsp files from Murachâ€™s distribution to display products to the user, or make up a simple one

A user can run this project in eclipse or Command prompt(windows/linux/mac) with help of ant.
